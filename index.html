        <div id="aboutDropdown" class="dropdown">
            Hi, I'm Shawn—a first-year college student currently enrolled in the Department of Criminology. 
            I'm someone who loves learning new things, even if they don’t always serve a practical purpose—
            because for me, curiosity is its own reward. I have a wide range of hobbies, but one that stands 
            out the most is playing video games. Out of all the games I've played, Dota holds a special place 
            in my heart. That’s why I’ve decided to dedicate this webpage to celebrating everything I love 
            about the game (well, not everything but a glimpse)—from epic plays and favorite heroes to unforgettable 
            matches. Whether you're a fellow gamer or just curious, I hope you enjoy exploring this digital tribute 
            to a game that’s more than just a pastime—it's a passion.

        <a id="dotaBtn">Dota 2</a>
        <div id="dotaDropdown" class="dropdown">
            Dota 2 is one of those games that’s easy to get into but really hard to master—and that’s what makes it so addicting. 
            It’s a 5v5 online battle game where each player picks a unique hero, and the goal is to take down the enemy team’s Ancient 
            (basically their base) while protecting your own. What makes Dota 2 stand out is the huge variety of heroes, endless 
            strategies, and how no two matches ever feel the same. Whether you’re into making big plays, supporting your team, or 
            just trying out different builds, there’s always something new to learn. Plus, with things like cool cosmetic items, 
            regular updates, and massive tournaments like The International, the game stays fresh and exciting. It’s more than 
            just a game—it’s a whole experience.

        <div id="heroesDropdown" class="dropdown">
            <div class="hero-name">Morphling</div>
            Morphling is a slippery and highly versatile hero who can shift his strength and agility on the fly, making him hard to kill and dangerous in fights. 
            He can morph into enemy heroes, steal their abilities, and turn the tide of battle with insane burst damage or survivability. 
            Whether you build him as a glass cannon or a tanky frontliner, Morphling is all about skill, timing, and flexibility.

            <div class="hero-name">Troll Warlord</div>
            Troll Warlord is a high-tempo carry who shines in extended fights. 
            He can switch between ranged and melee attacks, letting him chase down enemies or kite them from a distance. 
            His ultimate, Battle Trance, keeps him alive even when he’s on the brink of death, making him a terrifying force 
            in 1v1 duels or chaotic team fights. Once Troll gets his items, he becomes a machine that’s hard to stop.

            <div class="hero-name">Juggernaut</div>
            Juggernaut is a classic and reliable carry that’s great for both beginners and veterans. 
            With his iconic Blade Fury and game-changing ultimate, Omnislash, he can deal serious damage while staying safe. 
            His healing ward also gives great sustain for his team during pushes and fights. Juggernaut’s mix of mobility, 
            healing, and damage makes him a solid pick in almost any situation.
